Customer Personality Analysis Using Clustering Algorithms


Customer personality analysis helps businesses change their products and marketing services based on customer behaviours.

This implies cost reductions and improvements in customer satisfaction  in different ways:
- identify customers close to churn by tracking their behaviour over time.
- offering specific add-ones to the right customers.
- Analyzing business processes in terms of  improving overall profit.

In this project, we analyzed the customer's personality using various clustering algorithms.
